# Joe Ben Wheat Collection on Textiles

The documentation of these textiles includes detailed descriptions, images, and dye analysis test results. While most of Wheat's research focused on Navajo textiles, he also studied Pueblo, Hope, Zuni, and Spanish Colonial textiles. All images are sourced from the larger Joe Ben Wheat collection on textiles in the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History (CUMNH) archives.
