Blue-borders is a Diné (Navajo) subtype of manta which is similar to a Pueblo manta dress but characterized by tapestry twill. Diné fancy mantas were a continuation of earlier one-piece dresses or mantas and were worn as shawls or blankets. Gradually the fancy manta (shawl) transitioned from a open twill weave to a tapestry weave and included designs typical of other tapestry weaves. The term ""white center"" in the title of this file refers to a design element used in certain mantas.
